# cs400project01
Book Store

This is the first project in cs400. The goal of the project was to implement a real life example of using a hash table. My group consists of two data wranglers, two backend developers, a front end developer, as well as a tester. My part was backend developer, and the code I wrote is in BookStore.java.

We decided our project would be a small used bookstore. It holds a maximum of 20 books (read: "small bookstore") and the user can buy a book, donate a book, as well as steal all of the books. This simple project relies on ISBN numbers to retrieve and put in books. Each book is comprised of its ISBN number, the title, the genre, as well as how many of that version of book we have in stock.
